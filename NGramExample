Example 1:
Rome is not built in a day.
Here there are no repeated words. So 
unigrams --> not,  in, day, is, a, built, Rome
bigrams --> Rome is, is not, not built, built in, in a, a day.
trigrams --> Rome is not, is not built, not built in, built in a, in a day.

here as there is no repetetion of words, 
number of unigrams > number of bigrams > number of trigrams.

Example 2:
horse is a horse, of course, of course. accept  it
Here there are repeated words
unigrams --> horse, of, course, a, is, it, accept
bigrams --> horse is, is a , a horse, horse of, of course, course of, course accept, accept it
trigrams --> horse is a, is a horse, a horse of, horse of course, of course of, course of course, of course accept, course accept it
Here there is repetetion of words in the given sentence. Hence
number of unigrams < number of bigrams < number of trigrams.
